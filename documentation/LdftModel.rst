Documentation on LdftModel
==========================

*class* ``ldft_classes_v2.ldft_model.LdftModel(size, mu_fix, mu=None, dens=None, v_ext=None, r=None, r_hist=None, err_hist=None, it_hist=None, bound_cond='periodic')``

Base: ``abc.ABC``

LdftModel is an abstract base class for lattice density functional
theory (ldft) models. It provides an interface for every ldft model.
This means functions specific to a certain model are predefined and
must be implemented in a class inheriting "LdftModel". Functions
applicable to any model (eg. picard updates) are completely
implemented. This safes a lot of work and redundancy.
Further it supports a structure to administer a lattice system
through various instance variables and functions. If you want to
define your one model, just create a class inheriting "LdftModel"
and overwrite the abstract methods.

The following features are supported:

- Multiple species
    - Decide individually which species should be considered canonical or grand-canonical during picard iteration with the ``_mu_fix``-attribute
- Various boundary conditions
    - supported are 'periodic' and some tilted boundary conditions (for creating tilted liquid-vapor-interfaces) (see the ``_bound_cond``-attribute)
    - Further individual boundary conditions may be added, by modifying the ``_boundary_roll``-method
- Calculating the grand-canonical and a semi-grand-potential from your free energy (see ``cal_Om`` and ``cal_semi_Om`` methodes)
- Help functions for implementing your free energy functional (see ``_cal_Phi_id``, ``_cal_Phi_0``, ``_cal_dPhi_0``, ``_cal_d2Phi_0``)
- Functions for picard iteration (see ``make_picard_iteration``)
- Creation of individual initial profiles (see ``create_init_profile``)
    - Help functions for creating more customized profiles (``return_hom_densProfile``, ``return_nuc_densProfile``)
- Easy save and load methods to save the iterated sample and reuse it later (``save_syst``, ``load_syst``)
- Some pre-implemented functions for representation of:
    - samples (``print_2d_profile``, ``print_2d_profile2``, ``print_2d_hist``, ``print_2d_hist2``)
    - the error history (``print_error``)
- Some functions to calculate interface properties
    - calculate droplet radius at the surface of tension or equimolar dividing surface (``cal_R_s``, ``cal_R_em``)
    - calculate surface tensions at various dividing surfaces (``cal_gamma_R``, ``cal_gamma_s``, ``cal_gamma_em``, ``cal_gamma_inf``)


Parameters
----------
size : `Tuple`
    It defines the amount of lattice sites for each dimension.
mu : `List`, optional: default = `None`
    Contains the chemical potential for every species. Supports also
    type `None` as entry (eg. [0.3, None, None]), if just the
    chemical potential of certain species should be given. See also
    ``mu_fix``. Choose `None` if you do not want to set any entry.
dens : `List`; Optional: default = `None`
    Contains the systems average density for every species. Supports
    also `None` as entry (eg. [None, 0.4, 0.4]), if just the
    density of a certain species should be given. See also
    ``mu_fix``. Choose `None` if you do not want to set any entry.
mu_fix : `List`
    Contains a boolean value for each species deciding whether the
    chemical potential should be kept fixed during picard iteration
    or not. `True` value treads the corresponding species as
    grand-canonical, `False`-species are treated canonical. The
    ``True``-values require a number value in the corresponding
    ``mu``-argument whereas the ``False``-values require a number
    value in the ``density``-argument at a picard-iteration.
v_ext : `List`; Optional: default = `None`
    List of numpy.array of same shape as the ``size``-parameter.
    Contains an external potential for every species. Choose `None`,
    for zero external potential for every species.
r : `List`; Optional: default = `None`
    List of numpy.array of same shape as the ``size``-parameter. Each
    array corresponds to the density profile of a species. Choose
    `None` in case you hand over the ``r_hist``-parameter or in case
    you do not want to set the variable yet.
r_hist : `List`; Optional: default = `None`
    Picard-history of a density profile. It contains the density
    profiles for certain picard-steps of a system which has already
    been evolved through picard iteration. Every entry is of the
    format of the ``r``-parameter. Use `None` if the system has no
    history yet.
err_hist : `List`;  Optional: default = `None`
    Contains the error at the picard-steps corresponding to the
    entries of `r_hist`. The entries are lists containing an error
    for every species. Use `None` if no history available.
it_hist : `List`; Optional: default = `None`
    List of the picard steps corresponding to the density profiles at
    the ``r_hist``-parameter. Use `None` if no history available.
    Note: if ``r_hist`` is given then also this argument should be
    assigned with an appropriate list.
bound_cond : `String`; Optional: default value 'periodic' Determines the
    boundary condition (bc). Values available: 'periodic' for periodic bc,
    '11_if' for 2d systems with 45째 tilted bc (to create 45째 slab
    interfaces (11-interfaces)), '110_if' for 3d systems with a 45째 tilted
    bc with respect to one axis (for 110-interfaces), '111_if' for 3d
    systems with a 45째 tilted bc with respect to two axis (for
    111-interfaces), 'pad' for a system, which is connected to a reservoir
    in the first dimension (0'th axis) and periodic in all other
    dimensions. For '11_if', '110_if' and '111_if' the ``size``-argument
    should be chosen in that way, the first two axis are of equal length
    and one and the last one is of twice that length (cuboid with square
    front face and long edge twice the short edges). If one wants to make
    use of the ``bound_cond``-argument one needs to use the
    ``_boundary_roll``-method for rolling the density profile instead of
    numpy.roll in the class implementing the specific model. The variable
    can be easily extended to further accepted values by adapting the
    ``self._boundary_roll``-method.

    initial value. Otherwise it is initialised with `0`.  It is updated
    after every picard-update (see description of
    ``_make_picard_update``). Every time the ``set_r`` function is
    called, ``_it_counter`` is being reset to `0`.

        ``True``-values require a number value in the corresponding
        ``mu``-argument whereas the ``False``-values require a number
        value in the ``density``-argument at a picard-iteration.

        history yet.
    err_hist : `List`;  Optional: default = `None`
        Contains the error at the picard-steps corresponding to the

        chosen in that way, the first two axis are of equal length and
        one and the last one is of twice that length (cuboid with square
        front face and long edge twice the short edges). If one wants to
        make use of the ``bound_cond``-argument one needs to use the
        ``_boundary_roll``-method for rolling the density profile
        instead of numpy.roll in the class implementing the specific
        model. The variable can be easily extended to further accepted
        values by adapting the ``self._boundary_roll``-method.

Methods concerning the minimization
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``make_picard_iteration(self, alpha, it_steps, checkp_method, min_err=None)``

    Calls ``it_steps`` times the method ``_make_picard_update``
    with the update parameter ``alpha``. The iteration can be
    prematurely aborted when the iteration error fall below a minimal
    error ``min_err``. When ``self._it_counter`` reaches certain
    values (checkpoints) the current profile is appended to the
    ``self._r_hist``-attribute by calling ``_append_hist``. The next
    checkpoint is calculated by ``_set_new_checkp`` according to the
    parameter ``checkp_method``. Before exiting the function the last
    profile is also appended to ``_err_hist`` with ``_append_hist``.

    **Parameters**

    alpha : `Float`
        Value between 0 and 1. Determines how 'fast' the iteration is
        done (The higher, the faster). In case of to high ``alpha``
        the danger of divergence arises.
    it_steps : `Int`
        Number of iteration steps
    checkp_method : `String`
        Determines in which intervals the profile should be
        appended to the ``_r_hist``-attribute. Possible values:

        by a number. See description of ``_set_new_checkp``.
    min_err : `Float`
        Determines at which error the iteration can be aborted
        prematurely.
        
Methods for creating the initial density profile
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``create_init_profile(self, dens=None, shape=None)``

    Creates an initial density profile for each species the
    picard iteration can start with. A list of average density of
    each species is handed over via the ``dens``-parameter.
    Additionally a nucleus can be placed in the density profile of
    each species, the shape of which determined by the
    ``shape``-parameter. Calls the function ``self.set_r`` to set
    the density profile to the variable ``_r``. The Nucleus further
    satisfies the boundary condition ``_bound_cond``

    **Parameters**

    dens : `List`
        Determines the average density of each species.
    shape : `List` of `Tuples`
        The tuples determines the shape of the nucleus for each

        expand 3x4.
        
----

``create_init_100_if(self)``

    Creates an initial density profile with an [100]-interface. Half of
    the profile is filled by the coexisting vapor density value and the
    other half by the coexisting liquid density value. The interface
    between both sides is hard. The resulting profile is assigned to the
    `_r`-variable of the calling instance by applying the `set_r` method.

----

``create_init_wedge_if(self)``

    Creates an initial density profile. The profile continuously fades
    from one coexisting density to the other (the density thus resembles a
    wedge). The resulting profile is assigned to the `_r`-variable of the
    calling instance by applying the `set_r` method.
        
----

``return_hom_densProfile(self, dens)``

    Returns a homogeneous one species density profile with
    density according to the parameter ``dens``. The shape of which
    is determined by the `_size`-instance variable.

    **Parameters**

    dens : `Float`
        Density of the homogeneous profile.

    **Returns**

    Profile : `np.array`
        The resulting density profile.

----

``return_nuc_densProfile(self, dens, shape)``

    Returns a one species density profile with average density
    according to the ``dens``-parameter and a nucleus of shape
    determined by the ``shape``-parameter. The nucleus further
    satisfies the boundary condition ``_bound_cond``.

    **Parameters**

    dens : `Float`
        Average density of the profile.
    shape : `Tuple`
        Determines the shape of the nucleus. E.g. (3, 4) for a
        2d-system with a nucleus of expand 3x4.

    **Returns**

    Profile :`np.array`
        The density resulting profile.

Methodes for setting some attributes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``set_r(self, r)``

    This function is used for assigning a new initial profile
    ``r`` to the instance variable ``_r``. Therefor the
    ``_it_counter`` is being reset to '0' and the history
    attributes ``_r_hist``, ``_it_hist``, ``_err_hist`` are updated.

    **Parameters**

    r : `List` of `numpy.array`
        New initial density profile for each species.

``set_hist(self, r_hist, it_hist, err_hist)``

    This function is to manually set the internal history
    variables ``_r_hist``, ``_it_hist`` and ``_err_hist``. The last
    entry of the ``r_hist``-parameter is assigned to the instance
    variable ``_r``, which is the current density profile.

    **Parameters**

    r_hist : `list` of `list` of `numpy.ndarray`
        Iteration history of the density profile. This parameter
        should be of the following format [profile_0, profile_1,...]
        where ``profile_i`` is the profile of the i'th iteration
        step and has the format [r_1, r_2, ...], where the entries
        are the profile of the corresponding species.
    it_hist : `list` of `int`
        This parameter lists the corresponding iteration steps of
        the ``r_hist`` parameter.
    err_hist : `list` of `list` of `float`
        History of the picard error. It is of the following format:
        [err_0, err_1,...] where err_i is the error of the i'th
        iteration step and is a list itself, with an error entry for
        every species.
 
Methodes for saving the system

``save_syst(self, path, filename)``

    Uses ``pickle.dump`` to save the instance variables of a
    system.

    **Parameters**

        a absolute path)
    filename : `String`
        The filename under which the system should be stored.
        
----

*classmethod* ``load_syst(cls, path, filename)``

    Uses ``pickle.load`` to load a system. It is strongly
    recommended to override this method in the inherited classes,
    as the returned system might be of an outdated type! A typecast
    should be implemented!

    **Parameters**

    path : `String`
        Directory in which the system is stored which one want's to
        load (needs to be a absolute path)
    filename: `String`

    **Returns**

    Model : `LdftModel`
        The returned model probably has the type of an inherited
        class. It might also be the class of an outdated type.

        If `None`, the iteration steps which are plotted are chosen
        equidistant in the ``_it_hist``-list. Alternatively one can
        choose ones own list. This list, however, does not contain
        the iteration-steps which shall be plotted, but the indices
        of those.

    delta Omega : `Float`
        Delta of the grand potential
        
----

``cal_R_s(self)``

    Calculates the radius of surface of tension. In case of a
    Cylinder configuration in three dimensions, the cylinder has to
    point in the 0th axis of the density profile ``self._r``.

    **Returns**

    Radius of s.o.t. : `Float`
        Radius of surface of tension

----

``cal_R_em(self, em_species=0)``

    Calculates the equimolar radius for the species given by
    ``em_species``. In case of cylinder configurations in three
    dimensions the cylinder has to point in the 0th axis of the
    density profile ``self._r``. This function does only work
    properly, if a droplet/cylinder is embedded in a supersaturated
    vapour. For configurations of bubbles or vapour cylinders
    embedded in liquid, the result will be wrong.

    **Parameters**

    em_species : `Int`; Optional: default=0
        Decides for which species the equimolar radius should
        be calculated

    **Returns**

----

``cal_gamma_R(self, R)``

    Calculates the surface tension at the position ``R`` of the
    interface. For droplets and cylinders ``R`` is the radius, for slabs
    ``R`` corresponds width of the liquid portion. In case of cylinder
    configurations in three dimensions the cylinder has to point in the 0th
    axis of the density profile ``self._r``. In case of slab interfaces the
    function assumes a single interface (and not two interfaces separating
    liquid-vapor-liquid).

    the equimolar surface of a given species. In case of cylinder
    configurations in three dimensions the cylinder has to point in
    the 0th axis of the density profile ``self._r``. This function
    does only work properly, if a droplet/cylinder is embedded in a
    supersaturated vapour. For configurations of bubbles or vapour
    cylinders embedded in liquid, the result will be wrong.

    surface of tension for a given species. This function
    does only work properly, if a droplet/cylinder is embedded in a
    supersaturated vapour. For configurations of bubbles or vapour
    cylinders embedded in liquid, the result will be wrong.

    **Parameters**

    **Returns**

    Adsorption : `Tuple` of `Float`
        First entry: Adsorbed particle number; Second entry:
        adsorption.

----

``cal_gamma_inf(self, area)``

    Calculates the surface tension of a flat interface. This
    function can not determine the area of the surface itself.
    Therefore it has to be passed as parameter.

    **Parameters**

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

*class* ``_RespectBoundaryCondition()``

    Decorator class: If this Decorator is applied to an instance method,
    it checks the `_bound_cond`-attribut of the calling instance. In case
    that `_bound_cond` is 'pad', it pads the density profile `self._r` with
    the coexisting vapor and liquid values respectively to the right and
    left of the first dimension (0'th axis) by one lattice site for each
    apparent species. This decorator needs to be applied on instance
    methods which makes calculations on the density profile by rolling the
    weighted densities. (The only case known to me where this is required
    is for calculating the excess chemical potential or similar values.)
    For calculation where only the rolling of the density profile itself is
    required the function need not to be decorated by this decorator, since
    the padding is captured by the function `_boundary_roll` then.  However,
    when the weighted densities need to be rolled, `_boundary_roll` does
    not know with which value it needs to pad.  After that calculation the
    density profile is again trimmed to the original size.
    
----

*classmethod* ``_tilted_roll_3d(cls, array, steps, roll_axis, shift, shift_axis)``

    Rolls a 3d numpy array in the manner of numpy.roll in
    direction of ``roll_axis``, but with different boundary
    conditions. The padding happens after the opposite surface, but
    shifted. The shift corresponds to another rolling in direction of
    a ``shift_axis`` unequal the ``shift_axis``.

    **Parameters**

    array : `numpy.array`
        A 3d array which should be rolled.
    steps : `int`
        Number of steps of the rolling. Negative numbers for rolling
        in negative direction.
    roll_axis : `int`
        Axis in which direction should be rolled. Possible values:
        1, 2 and 3.
    shift : `int`
        Shift of the padding area with respect to the opposite
        surface of the array.
    shift_axis : `int`
        Axis in which the shift should be done. Possible values: 1,
        2 and 3 but not the same value as in ``roll_axis``.

    **returns**

    Rolled array : `numpy.array`
    
----

*classmethod* ``_tilted_roll(cls, array, steps, roll_axis, shift, shift_axis)``

    See the description of ``_tilted_roll_3d``. This function
    makes the same but independent of the dimension of the array
    which should be rolled.

    **Parameters**

    array : `numpy.array`
        A 2d or 3d array which should be rolled.
    steps : `int`
        Number of steps of rolling. Negative numbers for rolling in
        negative direction.
    roll_axis : `int`
        Axis in which direction should be rolled.
    shift : `int`
        Shift of the padding area with respect to the opposite
        surface.
    shift_axis : `int`
        Axis in which the shift should be done.

    **Returns**

    The rolled array : `numpy.array`
   
----

*classmethod* ``_pad_roll(cls, array, steps, axis)``

    Pads the array with one side of the array and trims it on the other
    side by the same amount of lattice sites, such that the shape of the
    array remains the same. The padding happens with the edge values of the
    array.

    **Parameters**

    array : `numpy.array`
        The array which shall be padded
    steps : `int`
        Number of values padded to the edge of the axis. Positive values
        pad on the lower side of the array, negative on the upper side.
    axis : `int`
        The axis of the array which shall be padded.

    **Returns**

    pad : `np.array`
        The padded array

----

``_boundary_roll(self, r, steps, axis=0)``

    Performs the rolling of a density profile under consideration of the
    boundary condition in the class variable ``_bound_cond``.  If the
    boundary condition is 'periodic', then an ordinary `numpy.roll` is
    performed. In case of '11_if', '110_if' or '111_if' boundary conditions
    the function ``_tilted_roll`` is applied in an appropriate way to
    satisfy the given boundary condition while rolling. For the 'pad'
    boundary condition, the ``_pad_roll`` function is used.

    **Parameters**

    r : `numpy.array`
        The density profile which should be rolled.
    steps : `int`
        Number of steps of rolling. Negative numbers for rolling in
        negative direction.

    The rolled array : `numpy.array`

Help-methods for the picard iteration
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``_make_picard_update(self, alpha)``

    Runs one Picard-Iteration. The instance variable ``_mu_fix``
    decides whether the density or the chemical potential is to be
    kept fixed during the iteration. When ``_mu_fix[i]``==`False` for
    one species ``i``, the density is kept fix for this species and
    the ``_mu``-attribute for the same is updated. In case of `True`,
    the chemical potential ``_mu[i]`` is kept constant and the
    density `_dens[i]` is going to be updated. The variable `_r` is
    being updated, where the updated `r` is a superposition of the
    old ``_r`` and the iterated ``r``. The `alpha`-parameter steers
    the contribution of the iterated ``r`` to that superposition.
    Finally 'self._it_counter'-Variable is increased by one.

    **Parameters**

    alpha : `Float`
        Value between 0 and 1. Determines how 'fast' the iteration
        is done (The higher, the faster). In case of to high
        ``alpha`` the danger of divergence arises.

    **Returns**

    r : `List`
        The iterated density profile.
    error : `List`
        The error for each species.
        In case of divergence prints 'divergent!!!' and returns nothing.
    
----

``_set_new_checkp(self, checkp_method)``

    Calculates the next 'checkpoint' meaning an iteration number
    at which the current density profile ``_r`` should be appended to
    ``self._r_hist``. The next checkpoint is determined by the current
    value of ``_it_counter`` and the method defined by the
    parameter ``checkp_method``. 

    **Parameters**

    checkp_method : `String` or `Int`
        Determines how the next checkpoint is calculated. Recommended
        value: 'dec2'. It can take the following values:
        integer value (for equidistant checkpoints with interval of
        the integer); 'exp#' where # is to be replaced by a float
        value (next checkpoint is last checkp to the power of float);
        'dec#' where # is replaced by an integer (if e.g. #==3, the
        checkpoints goes like this: 30, 60, 90, 100, 300, 600, 900,
        1000, 3000, ...).

    **Returns**
